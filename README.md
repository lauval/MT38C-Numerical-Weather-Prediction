# MT38C Numerical Weather Prediction 
MT38C Numerical Weather Prediction is a final year module offered at the University of Reading. It is a mix of theory and practical classes and involves solving some of the equations of motion associated with fluid flow. 

This repo doesn't offer any installable files. It is simply a collection of my coded solutions to the weekly practicals. 
The jupyter notebooks are *not* model solutions to the weekly problem tasks, either. They are here to showcase my skills in programming and numerical methods as part of my online coding portfolio.
